## Prompt 1

I personally think R is the easiest software I've used. I've used R, SAS, Python, and Matlab for my previous classes and R and Matlab are my favorites. I've mostly learned R by osmosis and trial and error (I took ST 308 but I forgot everything as soon as I learned it). I would warn complete beginners that R is probably difficult to learn but once you get used to it you will like it.
